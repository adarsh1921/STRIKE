### Project Description
[This project is a two-player "Push-to-Win" game using an Arduino, where players compete by pressing buttons to move an LED towards their side. The first player to push the LED to their end wins, with game status displayed on an LCD.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[This project humorously solves the "problem" of deciding who's faster by creating a fun button-mashing game with an LED race, perfect for friendly competition.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[A thrilling LED race game that lets two players mash buttons to claim victory, turning quick reflexes into ultimate bragging rights‚Äîbecause who *really* needed another way to settle friendly rivalries?]
